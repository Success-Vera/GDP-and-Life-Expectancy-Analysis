# GDP-and-Life-Expectancy-Analysis
This is a mini project that seeks to find out if there is a correlation between a country's GDP and life expectancy.
You can find the data for GDP at   http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD and for life expectancy at http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN. The datasets were downloaded as CSV files in June 2021.
