# GDP-and-Life-Expectancy-Analysis
Is there a correlation between a country's GDP and life expectancy? 

The analysis showed that the spearman's coefficent gives a weak correlation between life expectancy and GDP. However, a careful look at the countries with the least life expectancy shows that the top countries with the least life expectancy are African countries.

Furthermore, few of these countries still find themselves among the top 30 countries with low GDP.

Hence, we conclude that even if there is no strong correlation between life expectancy and GDP, countries in Africa have less life expectancy and then we can further research about other factors that may be responsible for life expectancy.


You can find the data for GDP at   http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD and for life expectancy at http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN. The datasets were downloaded as CSV files in June 2021.
